    <p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement applies to the 'Apply for  a felling licence' service.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This website is run by the Forestry Commission. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><a class="govuk-link" target="_blank" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet (opens in new tab)</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this website is</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible. This means that:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>some radio buttons that reveal extra content are not fully supported by screen readers</li>
        <li>maps and map controls cannot be used properly with a keyboard or with Dragon NaturallySpeaking voice software</li>
        <li>some links and dropdowns are not accessible to keyboard-only users or people using screen readers such as VoiceOver and TalkBack</li>
        <li>file upload buttons on some pages cannot be activated using Dragon NaturallySpeaking voice software</li>
        <li>some placeholder text cannot be deleted using assistive technology on mobile devices</li>
        <li>keyboard focus does not always move in a logical order when new content appears</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">These issues mean the website does not fully meet WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards. You can find more detail about each issue in the Known issues with this website section below.</p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Known issues with this website</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">We are aware of the following accessibility issues within the service:</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Radio buttons do not include the correct ARIA role</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">On pages like ‘Create a Property’ and ‘Felling Details’, radio buttons are used to reveal additional content. These use the aria-expanded attribute but do not include a required ARIA role such as menuitemradio.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This means the content may not be interpreted correctly by assistive technologies. This does not meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html">WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We have followed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/#conditionally-revealing-radios">GOV.UK Design System guidance for radios with conditionally revealing content</a>, but recognise that this approach may result in invalid HTML.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We are monitoring guidance and exploring alternatives.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Maps cannot be used with a keyboard or speech recognition software</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">On the ‘Create a compartment’ page, users cannot interact with the map using a keyboard. Users of Dragon NaturallySpeaking also cannot draw areas on the map using voice commands.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This does not meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This issue relates to third-party map content and cannot currently be fixed. We will monitor for improvements. A workaround is available on request.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Some links and dropdowns are not accessible by keyboard</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">On pages such as ‘Create a property’ and ‘Select felling options’, some links cannot be accessed without a mouse.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This may prevent keyboard-only users from accessing essential content. This does not meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Dropdowns and placeholder text may not work correctly with assistive technologies</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">On the ‘Felling details’ page, users navigating with VoiceOver or TalkBack cannot select species from the dropdown.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Placeholder text in the ‘Estimated total felling volume’ input cannot be fully deleted using a mobile keyboard.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This does not meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">File upload buttons may not work with Dragon NaturallySpeaking</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">On pages such as ‘Add agent authority form files’ and ‘Supporting documentation’, users of Dragon NaturallySpeaking may not be able to activate file upload buttons using voice commands.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This is believed to be a known issue with Dragon and does not meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html">WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value</a>.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">We will update this accessibility statement as we make progress on resolving these issues.</p>
